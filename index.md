    title: What can Cintra do for you?
    text: Are you a public sector client who will receive funding under the New Building Canada Fund or another provincial or federal program? Are you required to provide supporting documentation to senior government agencies before this funding will be committed, during project implementation and post completion?
Cintra Consulting is ready to provide expertise in guiding development of or completing a government supplied business case template or related document for this new funding program.

Are you a private company representative facing difficult capital investment decisions? Do you know what is needed, but could use a fresh set of eyes on it and require the supporting material to convince management or the Board of Directors?
Cintra Consulting can provide and document a rationale approach to investment decisions.
